# Customer Segmentation Project in R

## Introduction
This project demonstrates the application of **unsupervised learning** techniques, specifically **K-means clustering**, to divide customers into distinct segments. By analyzing customer data, businesses can optimize marketing efforts and product strategies to suit the unique needs of each group.

## What is Customer Segmentation?
Customer Segmentation involves grouping customers based on shared characteristics such as demographics, spending habits, and preferences. It enables businesses to:
- Customize marketing strategies.
- Enhance product design.
- Increase customer satisfaction and loyalty.

---

## Project Goal
The goal of this project is to use **K-means clustering** to identify customer segments, providing actionable insights that help businesses optimize their marketing and product strategies.

---

## Tools and Technologies
- **R Programming**
- Libraries: `tidyverse`, `cluster`, `ggplot2`, `factoextra`

---

## Key Benefits
- Understand diverse customer needs.
- Create focused marketing campaigns.
- Maximize business profitability.

## Clustering Insights
From the above visualization, we observe that there is a distribution of 6 clusters as follows:

- **Cluster 6 and 4** – These clusters represent the `customer_data` with the medium income salary as well as the medium annual spend of salary.

- **Cluster 1** – This cluster represents the `customer_data` having a high annual income as well as a high annual spend.

- **Cluster 3** – This cluster denotes the `customer_data` with low annual income as well as low yearly spend of income.

- **Cluster 2** – This cluster denotes a high annual income and low yearly spend.

- **Cluster 5** – This cluster represents a low annual income but its high yearly expenditure.

Additional PCA Analysis insights include:

- **Cluster 4 and 1** – These two clusters consist of customers with medium PCA1 and medium PCA2 score.
- **Cluster 6** – This cluster represents customers having a high PCA2 and a low PCA1.
- **Cluster 5** – In this cluster, there are customers with a medium PCA1 and a low PCA2 score.
- **Cluster 3** – This cluster comprises of customers with a high PCA1 income and a high PCA2.
- **Cluster 2** – This comprises of customers with a high PCA2 and a medium annual spend of income.
