## 1. Customer Segmentation Project in R

This project demonstrates the application of unsupervised learning techniques, specifically K-means clustering, to divide customers into distinct segments. By analyzing customer data, businesses can optimize marketing efforts and product strategies to suit the unique needs of each group.

## 2. Stock Price Prediction using LSTM

This project implements a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to predict Netflix stock prices using historical data. The model leverages deep learning techniques to forecast future price movements, achieving an RMSE of 0.0586 and MAPE of 5.92%. It demonstrates practical applications in financial forecasting and trading strategy development.
